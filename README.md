This directory contains sample machine learning projects I've completed in my *personal time* covering the trinity of machine learning: supervised learning, unsupervised learning, and deep learning.

I am also including a further example of unsupervised work I did in graduate school clustering text data scraped off the internet. I'm including this project because: it's an example of group work I've done, it's a demonstration of my abillity to use multiple programming languages to complete a task, and it uses unsupervised machine learning on *unstructured data*.
